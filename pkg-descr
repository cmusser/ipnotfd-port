ipnotfd monitors the addresses configured on a network interface, taking
action whenever they change. This enables management tasks such as
firewall reconfiguration and dynamic DNS updates to be performed as soon
as they are needed. This is useful for server hosts that use DHCP-
assigned public-facing addresses.
